# Concept-Builder
Concept Builder is a two-tier client-server, multi-user software package that provides management of a structured database 
through a predefined API of the database. A structured database provides an opportunity to construct tree-like hierarchical 
structures - Concepts - that are created by architects (designers) that organize data of any subject area in accordance with 
the principles of the object-oriented approach. The Concept Designer provides an environment for the existence, modification 
and interaction with users for an unlimited number of Concepts throughout their lifecycle. The predefined architecture of 
the indexed tablespace of the structured database, together with the database API, provides a high level of performance 
for Concepts' data access processes.
